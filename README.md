Hey! I’m Abisha Iqbal Gill, a BSCS student who’s diving deep into the world of web development. My main focus right now is building modern, responsive apps with React, and Tailwind CSS.

I come from a pre-med background but found my real spark in tech. For me, coding is less about writing lines of code and more about solving problems in a creative way. I enjoy experimenting, learning new tools, and shipping projects that actually work.

Still early in the journey, but I’m consistent — every project I finish takes me one step closer to becoming the kind of developer I want to be.
